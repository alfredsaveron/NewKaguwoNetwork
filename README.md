## What's Alf's Portfolio?
I wanted to create a simple Landing Page and a portfolio individually. In this way, Alf's Portfolio was created! 
I work day by day to make new features and improvements. I am trying to make it a completely different project from AestasFlores/Old Network.

## To-do List?
*Last Update: 02.27.21 (USA)*

- [ ] Page icons will be changed.
- [ ] Game pages will be improved.

## Thanks!
